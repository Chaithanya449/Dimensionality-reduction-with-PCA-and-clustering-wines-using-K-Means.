üç∑ Wine Dataset Clustering using PCA & K-Means

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and K-Means Clustering to group wines based on their features. The purpose is to simplify high-dimensional data into fewer components while still retaining meaningful variance, making clustering more effective and visualization possible in 2D. The workflow involved preprocessing the data, applying PCA, running K-Means, and visualizing the resulting clusters. One of the challenges faced was selecting the optimal number of clusters and ensuring minimal information loss during dimensionality reduction. Future improvements could include experimenting with other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering, and comparing PCA with t-SNE or UMAP. In conclusion, this project demonstrates how combining dimensionality reduction and clustering provides powerful insights into complex datasets in an unsupervised learning setting.
