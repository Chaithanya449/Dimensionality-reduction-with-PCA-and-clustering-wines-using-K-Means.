🍷 Wine Dataset Clustering using PCA & K-Means
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used for dimensionality reduction and how K-Means Clustering can help in grouping similar wines.

The main goal is to simplify the high-dimensional wine dataset into fewer features using PCA, and then apply clustering to discover natural groupings. This project is a hands-on implementation of Unsupervised Machine Learning.
⚙️ Key Steps
1.Data Preprocessing
2.Loaded the Wine dataset.
3.Handled feature scaling using StandardScaler.
4.Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
5.Reduced high-dimensional features into 2 principal components.
6.Retained maximum variance for better visualization.
7.Clustering with K-Means
8.Implemented K-Means to group wines into clusters.
9.Used PCA components to visualize clustering in 2D.
10.Visualization
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
NumPy, Pandas
Scikit-learn (PCA, KMeans, StandardScaler)
📊 Results & Insights
PCA successfully reduced dimensionality while preserving variance.
K-Means clustering revealed meaningful groupings in the dataset.
Visualization showed distinct clusters of wines in the PCA-reduced space.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
